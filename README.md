# KickStart for Front-end development

KickStart for optimising your front-end development and building quickly static web pages through [**gulpjs**](http://gulpjs.com/) and [**bootstrap-sass**](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass).

Using gulpjs you can take advantage of the nodejs syntax and nodejs streams, developing your front-end more quickly than using another task runner like [**gruntjs**](http://gruntjs.com/).
